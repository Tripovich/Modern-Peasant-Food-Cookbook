        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>
            Roughly cube the eggplant, put it in a bowl, lightly cover with salt and stir it with your hands. Leave for
            about half an hour on a pasta strainer so it drains out liquid. <br><br>
            Slice zucchini into slices wide as a finger and the capsicums into strips wide as a thumb.<br><br>
            In a deep pan heat up 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the zucchini until it goes golden on the surface
            (about 2,5 minutes each side). When it's ready use a sieve spoon to put all zucchini in a large pot (and
            save the rest of the oil). <br><br>
            Add another spoon of olive oil to the pan. Sear the capsicum and when done - add it to the pot. <br><br>
            Rinse the eggplant and dry it up. Add another 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the pan and fry the eggplant
            until it goes golden (around 5 minutes). When finished with it - add it to the pot. <br><br>
            Mix tomatoes, 2 spoons of parsley and the thyme in the pan, fry up for about 10 minutes. Add it all to the
            pot. <br><br>
            Start the burner under the pot and cook the whole dish for about 10 minutes until the vegetables are cooked,
            but not too soft. <br><br>
            Take the pot off the heat, stir in the rest of the parsley and half the basil. Now add salt and pepper and
            decorate with the rest of basil.
