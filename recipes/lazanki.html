        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>
            Start boiling the pasta. <br><br>
            Dice the onion and fry in a large pan on low heat until it starts going golden. Stir from time to time. 
            <br><br>While pasta and onions are on the stove, dice the mushrooms. Put them in a bowl.
            <br><br> Put the sauerkraut in a sieve (if you don't have one, pasta strainer should do).
            Wash it under running cold water, so you get rid of most of the salt. When washed, squeeze as much liquid with your hands as you can and then chop the "squeezed block" of sauerkraut into finer slices.
            <br><br>
            If the onion is golden already, add the mushrooms and fry them together until the mushrooms are cooked, then add the sauerkraut and fry everything on medium heat for about five minutes. Turn off the heat.
            <br><br>
            In a small bowl mix soy sauce, sugar, pepper and caraway seeds. Stir it well, so that sugar dissolves. Mix the seasoning with the sauerkraut and mushrooms in the pan.
            <br><br>
            Add in the pasta, stir it well and eat!
